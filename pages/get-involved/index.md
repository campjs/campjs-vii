## Community

One of the best aspects of CampJS is the community. Over the past 6 events, that
community has only grown stronger. As CampJS is a community run event, there is
always plenty to help with. If you want to help in any way (or just get in on
  all the pre-camp excitement), head over to the [#campjs](https://viewsource.slack.com/archives/campjs)
  channel on the [View Source Slack](http://view-source-radboats.herokuapp.com/).

## Sponsorship

If you are interesting in sponsoring, there are a number of packages available.
Contact [damon@campjs.com](mailto:damon@campjs.com) with any enquiries.
