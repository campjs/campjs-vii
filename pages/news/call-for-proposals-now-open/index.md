If you’re really lucky you’ll know that by submitting a proposal to speak at CampJS you can help shape the next generation of not only CampJS, but JavaScript in general.

Okay. You need to submit the proposal, and *then* present, but the submission is the first step and the Call For Proposals (CFP) is now open. You can find process here: http://cfp.campjs.com/

**[Take up the Call For Proposals](http://cfp.campjs.com/)**.

We're trialling an off-the-shelf CFP solution this camp, because we want you to have the best chance of getting your proposal to us. So please register, submit a talk, and have your say.

We want to hear you!

And don't forget that you don't need to talk to attend CampJS - we want to hear from you even if it's just around the camp fire.
