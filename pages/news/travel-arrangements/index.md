If arriving in Sydney by plane you will need to make your way to the Domestic Airport Station and catch a train to Hawkesbury River Station which is then a ~100m walk to Brooklyn Wharf.

Exact train timetables are not available yet but they appear to leave Domestic Airport Station roughly every hour.

This link [http://goo.gl/xpucJE](http://goo.gl/xpucJE) shows the trip for a different day as an indication.

## The trip required is:

- Domestic Airport Station -> Central Station (switch to Central Coast & Newcastle Line) -> Hawkesbury River Station
- It is then ~100m walk to Brooklyn Wharf
- Ferries will leave Brooklyn Wharf at 2:00PM and 5:00PM
- ~~The ferry times for the return trip are yet to be finalised but booking flights leaving Sydney after 2:00PM should allow plenty of time.~~
- Ferries for the return trip have been confirmed as leaving Broken Bay at 8am and 10am Monday

## Reminder

The venue was chosen **because** there is next to **no** phone connectivity.

Nada. Not a bit.

*VERY* tall people with the correct combination of planets and carriers can possibly get one bar, or there is a long hike to the top of a hill for other poor coverage.

There is however a land line for emergencies.

This is a reminder to *enjoy* no coverage not to *expect* no coverage :D
