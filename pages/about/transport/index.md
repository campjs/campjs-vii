If arriving in Sydney by plane you will need to make your way to the Domestic Airport Station and catch a train to Hawkesbury River Station which is then a ~100m walk to Brooklyn Wharf.

Exact train timetables are not available yet but they appear to leave Domestic Airport Station roughly every hour.

This link [http://goo.gl/xpucJE](http://goo.gl/xpucJE) shows the trip for a different day as an indication.

## The trip required is:

- Domestic Airport Station -> Central Station (switch to Central Coast & Newcastle Line) -> Hawkesbury River Station
- It is then ~100m walk to Brooklyn Wharf
- Ferries will leave Brooklyn Wharf at 2:00PM and 5:00PM
- Ferries for the return trip have been confirmed as leaving Broken Bay at 8am and 10am Monday
